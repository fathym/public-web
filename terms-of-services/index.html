PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY FATHYM PRODUCT OR SERVICE. BY USING ANY FATHYM PRODUCT OR SERVICE YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THESE TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT USE ANY FATHYM PRODUCT OR SERVICE. 

Fathym, Inc. (“Fathym”) is constantly improving our website, products and services (collectively, our “Products and Services”), and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Products and Services are offered. Fathym may modify all or any part of these Terms of Service from time to time without notice to you; you should visit our website often so you are aware of your current rights and responsibilities. If you previously entered into a prior version of terms of services, those terms no longer apply. Your continued use of our Products and Services after changes to the Terms of Service have been published constitutes your binding acceptance of the updated Terms of Service. If at any time the Terms of Service are no longer acceptable to you, you should immediately cease all use of our Products and Services. 

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS. PLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY. 

1. SERVICE 

Our website provides you with access to our Products and Services, as well as information, including but not limited to company details, industry insights and news, technological updates and access to Fathym’s blog. Fathym is under no obligation to provide such information, products and services to you. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current website, products and services shall be subject to these Terms of Service. 

You acknowledge that Fathym may establish general practices and limits concerning use of our Products and Services. You further acknowledge that Fathym reserves the right to modify these general practices and limits from time to time. Fathym reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, our website (or any part thereof), or any products and services, with or without notice. You agree that Fathym shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of our Products and Services. 

2. ELIGIBILITY 

You must be a human to use our Products and Services. Our Products and Services are not available to individuals under the age of thirteen (13) or who do not meet any of the other qualifications included in this agreement. If you are under age thirteen (13) or do not meet the qualifications in this agreement, do not attempt to access or use this website or any products and services. If you are age thirteen (13) or older but younger than age eighteen (18), then you may access and use our Products and Services only if your parent or guardian accepts this agreement on your behalf. If you are a parent or guardian entering this agreement for the benefit of a child between age thirteen (13) and eighteen (18), then you agree you will be solely responsible for all access to and use of our Products and Services. 

3. ACCOUNTS 

An account represents an individual’s authorization to login to and use certain Products and Services. Organizations may establish accounts as shared workspaces for multiple users associated with a single entity. Subject to these Terms of Service, you retain ultimate administrative control over your account and the content within it, and the “owner” of an organization’s account has ultimate administrative control over that organization’s account and the content within it. If you are the owner of an organization’s account under these Terms of Service, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed by any user through your organization’s account, and your organization is liable for any misuse by a user granted access to your organization’s account. 

Fathym has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of our Products and Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. Fathym reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. All provisions of this agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination will survive termination, including without limitation ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. 

4. USER NAME 

If you have an account, you agree to (i) provide Fathym with accurate, complete and up to date information; (ii) update your information to keep it accurate, current and complete; and (iii) comply with these Terms of Service. Failure to provide accurate information constitutes a breach of this agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your right to access our Products and Services. 

You may not select a user name that impersonates someone else, is or may be illegal, or may be protected by trademark or other proprietary rights, is vulgar or offensive or may cause confusion. Fathym reserves the right to reject any user name in our sole discretion. 

You agree not to sell or transfer your use of or access to any product or service or permit use to anyone else whose account was suspended or terminated through your user name or password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account and for all activity that occurs on your account. You agree to immediately notify Fathym of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. Fathym will not be liable for any loss you incur as a result of someone else using your password and account with or without your permission.

10. THIRD PARTY SERVICES 

Certain products or services, or portions thereof, may be provided by a third party or hosted on a third party platform (such as GitHub, npm, Azure or hardware and sensors). In order to use our Products and Services, you may be required to establish an account with the third party, in which case, you will be subject to the additional terms and conditions imposed by the third party. You confirm that you will abide by such terms and conditions, and you acknowledge that Fathym is not a party to those terms and conditions and these Terms of Service still apply. Fathym has no control over, is not responsible for and does not provide support for, any third party services. 

11. DIGITAL PARTNER OF RECORD 

If you are using Azure cloud management subscription services by Microsoft, and you use any Product or Service requiring Fathym to access Azure on your behalf, you must designate Fathym as your Digital Partner of Record (“DPOR”) granting us permission with the provider to help you design, build, deploy or manage the subscription service itself or a solution built on the subscription service. Fathym must be added as your DPOR each time a new subscription is sold, regardless of whether the service is new or existing. Only you can designate a DPOR for your subscriptions; this is not a task Fathym can do for you. 

12. RULES OF CONDUCT

You may not harvest or collect information about website visitors or users of our Products and Services without their express written consent.

Fathym may offer subscription-based access to our API for those users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of our Products and Services.

21. GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION 

This agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado (U.S.A.), without regard to or application of conflicts of law rules or principles. Any controversy, dispute or claim relating to our Products and Services and/or these Terms of Service shall be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration conducted at a site specified by Fathym in Denver, Colorado (U.S.A.), in the English language, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.

23. MISCELLANEOUS 

This agreement shall be interpreted in English (U.S.). You may translate this agreement into other languages. In the event of a conflict between any translated version of this agreement and the English version, the English version will control. The words “include,” “includes” and “including” means “include,” “includes” or “including,” in each case, “without limitation.” 

You may not assign this agreement; any attempted assignment will be deemed void and ineffective. Fathym’s delay or failure to exercise any rights under this agreement will not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights. This agreement is binding on you and Fathym and, other than as expressly provided in this agreement, nothing in this agreement grants any other person or entity any right, benefit or remedy. Your electronic signature will be effective to bind you to this agreement. 

If any provision of this agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions of this agreement will remain in effect to the greatest extent permitted by law. 

All notices under this agreement shall be in writing, in English. When you send a notice to Fathym (other than a notice of copyright infringement, as detailed above), such notice shall be deemed properly given when addressed to Fathym’s address as stated on our website and (1) delivered by personal delivery, (2) delivered by overnight courier service with signature required, or (4) mailed by first class U.S. mail with postage paid, return receipt requested. Fathym may send notices to you through our Products and Services or to any email address or physical address used by your account. 

If you enter into a separate contractual relationship with Fathym, such as an Enterprise Agreement (and/or Order Form), with terms that are different from those described in these Terms of Service, the terms of that agreement will apply.
